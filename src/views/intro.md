# Hello!

My name is _Jon Snyder_ and I work at ONE Discovery. We specialize in eDiscovery software.

My main focus is the front end architecture and design. We utilize Vue for our main interface, and we absolutely love it.

## Visualizing Data ðŸŒ´

My other obsession is Data Visualization. A big part of eDiscovery is navigating thru data.

Being able to see the information thru different lenses is crucial to our application. Aside from it looking cool, it has some very useful attributes.

### Holistic Displays ðŸ—º

When you have a large amount of data, it's very useful to get the big picture.

Presenting information in certain ways can have a huge impact.
