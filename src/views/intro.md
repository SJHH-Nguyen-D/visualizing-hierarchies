# Hello Everyone!

First off, thank you all for coming

My name is `Jon Snyder`. To quickly sum myself up...

Loved to design, discovered programming, loved it too

Learned Flash, combined both of my passions, best feeling ever

Flash died, felt lost, learned Javascript and Haxe

Got married, got motivated, became a workaholic

Now I'm 34, made an awesome family, moved to Florida

And currently am the UX Lead at [ONE Discovery](http://onediscovery.com)

## My Dataviz Obsession

We've all been exposed to charts of all different shapes and sizes. They give us a way to look at information thru different lenses, exposing patterns and differences we might not have seen before.

So why is this? It turns out that we humans have an interface too.

Our interpretation of the world is a direct cause of what our senses tell us. This is our interface.

Fortunately, our sense of sight makes up for 80% of this input

we are amazing at processing large amounts of visual data quickly, which is divided into multiple visual variables. These include:

1. Position
2. Size
3. Shape
4. Value (Lightness)
5. Color Hue
6. Orientation
7. Texture
8. Color Saturation
9. Arrangement
10. Crispness
11. Resolution
12. Transparency

Properties of visual variables include:

1. Selective
2. Associative
3. Ordered
4. Quantitative

We perceive visual variables depending on the property that it represents, and some work better than others depending on what is meant to be discovered.

For example, color wouldn't be helpful to detect proportional quantitative values, whereas size would give us a much better lens to estimate the numerical differences between symbols.

The realization that our brains can do this in lighting speed consumed me. And I have been exploring the possibilities ever since.

### The Plan

My goal is to get you excited to explore the data around you, and to share some of my solutions to achieve this.

We will be using Vue.js and D3.js to provide data manipulation in a reactive environment, and to show how powerful these two concepts are when used together.

We will start small by going over some features in both libraries, and work our way up to creating _meaningful_ hierarchical visuals.

Hierarchical data will be our main focus for visualizing, however you will learn patterns that can be used in other aspects of data visualization.

#### Let's do this!
