# What is a Hierarchy

They are simply groups of items _(nodes)_ that are connected to each other by links _(edges)_

We use them on a daily basis. Every project you work on has a hierarchical structure of files, for the sole purpose of organizing information that is human readable.

## They are everywhere

Many datasets can be grouped into a hierarchical format.

Information about global economy can be grouped into coutries, regions, subregions.

Every minute in a year can be grouped by the hour by the day > week > month

Collections of objects can be classified into groups, such as imagenet

Even Vue's nested component structure has a child / parent relationship.

## Use Cases

In some circumstances, visualizing a hierarchy might not be that beneficial if you are not comparing nodes against each other, or have any reason to view the information at a holistic scale.

However, in alot of cases, we can visualize the larger picture of a hierarchy set, allowing us to compare nodes by size, color, or any of the other dimensions described in [Semiology of Graphics](https://books.google.com/books/about/Semiology_of_Graphics.html?id=X5caQwAACAAJ).
