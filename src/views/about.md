# What is a Hierarchy

A Hierarchy is a special type of `graph`.

Graphs are simply structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

They consist of vertices (nodes) which are connected by edges (links).

hierarchies are `unidirected` trees that follow specific rules:

1. There must be a single root node with no parent
2. All nodes must have an edge
3. Must be acylic
4. Each node can only have 1 parent

Hierarchies serve many purposes, and we use them on a daily basis

- DOM Elements
- Folders / Files
- Decision Trees
- Binary Trees
- Family Trees
- Geography
- Organograms
- Taxonomy
- Word Trees

And so on...
