# What is a Hierarchy

A Hierarchy is a special type of `graph`.

Graphs are simply structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

They consist of vertices (nodes) which are connected by edges (links).

hierarchies are `unidirected` trees that follow specific rules:

1. There must be a single root node with no parent
2. All nodes must have an edge
3. Must be acylic
4. Each node can only have 1 parent

## They seem to be everywhere

Hierarchies serve many purposes, and we use them on a daily basis

- DOM Elements
- Folders / Files
- Decision Trees
- Binary Trees
- Family Trees
- Geography
- Organograms
- Taxonomy
- And many other forms of classification

## My Sudden Realization

[Kurt Koffka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka) was a German physchologist who helped establish `Gestalt Theory` alongside `Wolfgang Kohler` and `Max Wertheimer`

From this, they went on to develop the eight laws of perceptual organization, based off of these principles. This is where the Laws of UX originate from.

In other words, we do not perceieve our surroundings individually or equally. Instead, we organize them in specific ways to make sense of them as a whole.

## Wait, what?

Not sure what to be amazed about more. The fact that our human interface is naturally wired to interact with hierarchical stuctures, or the fact that the UX Laws we follow today are based off of the same principles...

## The laws

**Simplicity**: The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

**Hicks law**: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

**Millers law**: The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.

**Aesthetic usability affect**: Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design thatâ€™s more usable.

**Law of common region**: Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

**Laws of proximity**: Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

**Law of similarity**: The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.
