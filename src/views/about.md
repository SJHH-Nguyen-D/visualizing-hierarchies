# What is a Hierarchy

`Hierarchies` are amazing.

They are simply groups of items _(nodes)_ that are connected to each other by links _(edges)_

We use them on a daily basis. Every project you work on has a hierarchical structure of files, for the sole purpose of organizing information that is human readable.

## They are everywhere

Many datasets can be grouped into a hierarchical format.

Information about global economy can be grouped into coutries, regions, subregions.

Every minute in a year can be grouped by the hour by the day > week > month

Collections of objects can be classified into groups, such as imagenet
