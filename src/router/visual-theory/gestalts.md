# Gestalt Theory

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts.

Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

When we visually perceieve information, our brain helps us by using **shortcuts** to process it as a `whole`, even when parts are missing.

This is particulary interesting in respect to Design and UX, as most of these principles have become well known laws of UX.

## Structured Design

I started to realize that this approach of grouping and categorizing was in almost everything...

### Reading Patterns

Or `Reading Gravity` is the way in which we interpret a page design.

There's a couple ways that we _read_ a site design.

#### Z Pattern

Most Users will look from top left to top right, bottom left to bottom right. This creates a `Z` pattern of importance.

Used for alot of landing pages, simplistic designs.

#### F Pattern

This describes that users will look at the page title, moving inward towards more detailed information that mostly consists of readable text. Usually applied to users with a geniuine interest in the content of the page.

#### Consistent Behaviour

There is a common theme to this. We seem to perceieve the whole first, before diving into the details, regardless of the layout. We analyze the design as a whole to determine which parts we should focus on, before actually shifting focus.
