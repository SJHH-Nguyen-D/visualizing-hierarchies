# Order from Chaos

We as Human Beings, absolutely hate chaos. The moment our minds are presented with uncertainty, or disconnect, we immediately try to make sense of things.

Our Human behavior surrounds this notion that everything must have order. We are pattern seekers, and it is simply our way of understanding our environment to the best of our ability.

## Input

We try to figure out the world by using our senses. This is our `interface`. We take in tons of information and process it at lightning speed.

Out of all the senses we have, our sight 

We process this data by identifying bits and pieces, and organizing it smaller parts. Then reorganizing, over and over, into something that might have meaning.
