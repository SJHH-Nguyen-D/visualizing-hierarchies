# Order from Chaos

We as Human Beings, absolutely hate chaos. The moment our minds are presented with uncertainty, or disconnect, we immediately try to make sense of things.

Our Human behaviour surrounds this notion that everything must have order. We are pattern seekers, and it is simply our way of understanding our environment to the best of our ability.

## Input

We try to figure out the world by using our senses. This is our `interface`. We take in data in a multitude of ways.

One of them being `Sight`.

About 80% of how we process information, is vision. And we process it remarkably fast.

We process this data by identifying bits and pieces, and organizing it smaller parts. Then reorganizing, over and over, into something that might have meaning.
