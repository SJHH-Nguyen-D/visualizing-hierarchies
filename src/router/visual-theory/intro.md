# Order from Chaos

We as Human Beings, absolutely hate chaos. The moment our minds are presented with uncertainty, or disconnect, we immediately try to make sense of things.

Our Human behavior surrounds this notion that everything must have order. We are pattern seekers, and it is simply our way of understanding our environment to the best of our ability.

## Input

We try to figure out the world by using our senses. This is our `interface`. We take in tons of information and process it at lightning speed.

We process this data by identifying bits and pieces, and organizing it smaller parts. Then reorganizing, over and over, into something that might have meaning.

The `Bandwidth of our senses` compares the amount of information each of our senses _perceives_ per second.

You can see that visual perception is by far the most abundant. Note that the small dot in the left corner is when we become conscious of what we just sensed.

We can use this to our advantage when designing interactive content, and helps us make better decisions when creating interactive visuals.
