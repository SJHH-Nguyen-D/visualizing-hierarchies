# Order from Chaos

We as Human Beings, don't like chaos. The moment our minds are presented with uncertainty, or disconnect, we immediately try to make sense of it.

Our Human behavior surrounds this notion that everything must have order. We are pattern seekers, and it is simply our way of understanding our environment to the best of our ability.

## Input

We try to figure out the world by using our senses. This is our `interface`. We take in tons of information and process it at lightning speed.

We process this data by identifying, and organizing it smaller parts. Then reorganizing, over and over, into something that would have meaning.

### Memory

Our `short-term` memory is where the magic of making sense of things happen.

When we see something, new info gets passed into short-term memory while the old info gets passed into long term. This happens faster than our conscious speed of thought to help us make sense as fast as possible before we are consciously aware of it.

This is known as `Miller's Law`, which states that the average mind can only keep 7 Â± 2 items in it's working (short-term) memory.
