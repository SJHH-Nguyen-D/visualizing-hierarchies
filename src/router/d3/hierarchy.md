# D3.Hierarchy

When working with a unidirected hierarchy, you can get other useful information.

This essentially _wraps_ a new object around each one of your nodes, allowing you to add properties to each `node` without modifying the original data.

```javascript
// Put javascript here
```

## Summarizing

By default, any sort of hierarchical structure can be summarized by count, being that each `node` has no value associated with it.

```javascript
// Put Script Here
```

However, if each node can represent other values based on your collection, you can summarize any quantitative property.

```javascript
// Put Script Here
```

Summarizing hierarchical information is essential in visualizing the value of each group in a recursive manner.

## Sorting

Given that we organize things by order of importance, it makes sense to be able to sort each group of information by the value we give it.

```javascript
// Put Script Here
```
