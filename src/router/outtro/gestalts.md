# Gestalt Theory

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts.

Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

When we visually perceive information, our brain helps us by using **shortcuts** to process it as a `whole`, even when parts are missing.

This is particularly interesting in respect to Design and UX, as most of these principles have become well known laws of UX.

## Structured Design

It seems apparant that this approach of grouping and categorizing is in alot of what we do, even outside of our visual perception... We order groups of information based on a rating of importance.

We use this format logically, as well as visually perceiving the world around us.

### Reading Patterns

Or `Reading Gravity` is the way in which we interpret a page design.

There's a couple ways that we _read_ a site design.

#### Z Pattern

Most Users will look from top left to top right, bottom left to bottom right. This creates a `Z` pattern of importance.

Used for alot of landing pages, simplistic designs. This is shown in the `Gutenberg Diagram`

#### F Pattern

This describes that users will look at the page title, moving inward towards more detailed information that mostly consists of readable text. Usually applied to users with a genuine interest in the content of the page.

#### Consistent Behavior

More patterns emerge as time goes on, giving us more insight to what makes a pleasant experiences based on our behavior in visualizing content.

There is a common theme to this. We seem to perceive the whole first, before diving into the details, regardless of the layout. We analyze the design as a whole to determine which parts we should focus on, before actually shifting focus.
